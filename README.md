# BunnyPlugin
A Minecraft Plugin for making a rabbit as a pet.
This plugin is for a Minecraft server where you can add different animals as pets, similar to how wolves are befriended. The first addition to this is the Rabbit/Bunny.

To tame one of these animals, you need to use the food they like best, and it can take the same amount of uses as taming a dog.
  Rabbits will take carrots.
  
When you tame a rabbit, their skin will change to add a collar, and will allow you to change it to any color you like. (If there are no ways to change the skin, there will be a particle effect near their feet and the name of the owner above their head.

The pets will have certain features when you pet them, such as finding seeds in the grass or finding random crops. Some will even be able to attack.
